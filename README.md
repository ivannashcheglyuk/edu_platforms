## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app or any additional context you'd like to add.

- Fetching images for some educational platforms required testing multiple URLs.  
- Ensuring all logos fit nicely inside the cards took CSS adjustments.  
- Learned to use async/await with Supabase for CRUD operations.  
- Creating a cinematic card layout improved visual appeal.
